# Conexus IR Raspberry Pi
The CONEXUS IR Raspberry Pi is an IR remote control replacement for Frontier Silicon based devices like the TechniSat DigitRadio or AudioMaster series which do not have an IR remote support on their own.
The CONEXUS IR project aims to make these devices usable with a regular TechniSat IR remote control by translating the IR commands into network API control commands which are supported.
