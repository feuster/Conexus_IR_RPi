# Conexus IR RPi
This is a modified Raspberry Pi 1/2/3 capable of remote controlling Frontier Silicon based (Internet)Radios and Loudspeaker as the TechniSat DigitRadio and AudioMaster series.
To achieve this, commands from a regular TechniSat IR remote (Philips RC5 IR code based) will be translated into HTTP API calls for the remote device.
